## 👋 About Me
I’m a developer who loves speed, low-level detail, and shipping real products.  
I work across the stack: frontend, backend, infra, cryptography, and all the weird stuff in between.

## 🔥 What I’m Into
- High-performance cloud infrastructure  
- Decentralized + distributed networks  
- Crypto & zk-powered systems  
- Full-stack engineering with a focus on scale

## 📚 What I’m Learning
- Post-quantum cryptography  
Because why not prepare for the future before everyone else wakes up

### ⚠️ Note
Most of my serious work is in private repos.  
If this profile looks empty, it’s not because I’m not building stuff  
it’s because I’m building **actual products**, not portfolio fluff.
